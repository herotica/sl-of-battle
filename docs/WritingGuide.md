# Writing Guide

- fucker -> male
- reciever -> female

## Step 1

write an erotic story, 1 male, 1 female, avoid requiring a body shape (eg. big breasts, may allow for options in future release)

## Step 2

Replace using template literal (use specfic backticks) eg => `${p.name} frees ${p.pn.her} cock` becomes either "Jane frees her cock" or "John frees his cock", replacing text with character.

#### Replace Male/Player with p for Reciever/female use c

vscode & notepad++ have a very effective text replace tool

John -> name -> \${p.name}

Human -> ${p.race}
body shape -> ${p.bodyShape}
eye color -> ${p.eyeColor}
hair color -> ${p.hairColor}
skin color -> \${p.skinColor}

##### body part sizes

penis - > ${PenisSize[p.penisSize]}
breasts -> ${BreastSize[p.breastSize]}

#### Player only

Reciever is assumed female

his -> ${p.pn.her}
he -> ${p.pn.her}
him -> \${p.pn.self} (used as `${p.pn.self}self`)
his -> ${p.pn.her}
his -> ${p.pn.hers}
He -> ${p.pn.Cshe}
Him -> ${p.pn.Cself}
His -> ${p.pn.Cher}
His -> ${p.pn.Chers}
